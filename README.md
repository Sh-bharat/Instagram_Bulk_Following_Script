# Instagram_Auto/Bulk_Following
The Instagram Auto-Following Script is a powerful tool developed using JavaScript that allows users to automate the process of following Instagram accounts. By leveraging the Instagram API and various automation techniques, this script provides an efficient and convenient way to increase your following count.

The script is designed to be versatile and user-friendly. With a simple setup process, users can customize the script's parameters to target specific accounts or hashtags based on their preferences. By defining the criteria for accounts to follow, such as following count, engagement rate, or specific hashtags, the script ensures that the user's interactions are more targeted and relevant.

The Instagram Auto-Following Script operates in a continuous loop, automatically executing the follow action for selected accounts based on the defined criteria. It intelligently navigates Instagram's interface, simulating human-like behavior to avoid detection and potential restrictions. This helps users avoid potential penalties from Instagram's algorithms, ensuring a safer and more sustainable growth strategy.

Please note that while this script provides automation for following Instagram accounts, it's important to use such tools responsibly and in compliance with Instagram's terms of service. It's always recommended to maintain a healthy balance of organic interactions and engagement with your audience.
